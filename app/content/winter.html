							<h2>Winterisation</h2>
							<h4>It is a matter of choice how one decides how they want their pool winterized.
								The worry free method is to start with a perfectly chemically balanced pool and then blow all the water out of the equipment, skimmer and return lines and cap them with duck plugs or winterizing plugs. A bit more involved is if solar is a part of heating system. Then all the equipment is unhooked and drained of all water. The electrical and gas supply are also turned off. A winter blanket is then placed over their pool held in place with water bags, landscape ties, or in case of above ground pool the cover is held in place with a cable that is tightened with a winch. The only thing one has to do till spring opening is to drain rain water off of cover to reduce cover stretching and damage.</h4>

							<h4>The other method and becoming more popular is to keep the pool running with no cover, or in some cases where there is an automatic or safety cover which can be left on throughout winter. Bypass the heater and drain, but keep water chemically balanced keeping close eye on Ph and alkalinity. Adjust as needed - at least once a month. Maintain water level by draining to waste as the rain fills pool up. Rain on the west coast is high in acid and that is main reason why ph is so important to keep in check. If Ph drops too low it will start stripping copper off your heat exchanger if not bypassed, and compromise life of heater and the chemistry of pool. It is also beneficial to vacuum once in a while so that leaves and debris do not stain liner or concrete.</h4>

							<h4>This is a system that I built to vacuum very dirty green algae pools without going through clients system. It consisted of a pool pump with a GFCI switch and heavy duty cord plugged into 110 outlet. The water is vacuumed through vacuum head on pole attached to a hose that is connected to the pump. It then goes through a cartridge filter and then a cyclone centrifuge that returns rather cleaner water to pool. The filter is taken out periodically to clean and the centrifuge has a lever on it to empty debris collected in bottom of unit. This worked extremely well on pools that were neglected throughout winter. The cyclone centrifuge can be plumbed into your regular system to improve water quality and cut down on water waste through backwashing.</h4>

							<h4>It is a good idea to keep an eye on your pool pumps and other equipment during swimming season for any signs of leaking or loud noises that are not common. At the first sign of a pump leaking, it should be serviced by replacing the mechanical seal and any gaskets that are compromised. If the motor becomes very loud, there is a decision to be made. If pump is over 10 years old, I recommend replacing the pump as the newer ones run more efficiently. The motors can be replaced, which I do quite often, but labour is unpredictable on older pumps as they can be very difficult to disassemble.</h4>

							<h4>Filters must be maintained to perform as they were designed to. There are sand filters and cartridge filters being used on pools today. They both need to be cleaned to maintain water quality. Cartridges should be taken out at least once a year to clean and should be replaced when water quality can no longer be maintained. You can figure on no more than 3 years for a set of filters.
							Sand should be replaced every 7 years or at some point where water quality cannot be maintained. Again if your sand filter is ancient, parts are not available for them and the entire unit should be replaced.</h4>
