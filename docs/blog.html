							<h2>Summer</h2>

							<p class="blog-indent">Swimming season is in full swing now. Just a few tips to help you maintain crystal clear water and safe chemical usage.</p>

							<p> 
								<ul>
								<li>Running your circulation system 24 hours a day 7 days a week with proper chemical balance is the best method to ensure you do not run into problems. </li>
								<li>Keep your Ph between 7.2 and 7.6 </li>
								<li>Keep your Alkalinity between 80 ppm and 110 ppm. This buffers your Ph and prevents fluctuation which most time eliminates use of Ph up and Ph down. </li>
								<li>Keep your chorine between 1ppm and 3ppm to ensure proper sanitation.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>


							<p>In The Lower Mainland we have very soft water measuring 20ppm. For vinyl liner pools we recommend adding calcium chloride to maintain a level of up to 200 ppm. Concrete pools require a <strong>minimum</strong> of 200 ppm as the water will draw calcium from the walls and floor to satisfy its need, creating a very rough surface in your pool. 
							</p>

							<p>The pool should be shocked once a week with a super chlorinator product to burn up organics left behind by swimmers and the environment. I also recommend adding an enzyme called Phosfree to destroy phosphates in the pool which algae feeds on.</p>

							<p>If you use a solar cover, remember that it will cause algae to appear if left on for days at a time. Take it off at least every 2 days when the pool is not in use, to let pool breathe. Also leave it off after shocking the pool as this creates a gas that will melt a solar cover, voiding any warranty that the cover carries.</p>

							<p>
								Have a safe and fun summer!
							</p>

							<h2>Winterizing pools</h2>

							<p class="blog-indent">It is a matter of choice how one decides how they want their pool winterized.</p>

							<p>The worry free method is to start with a perfectly chemically balanced pool and then blow all the water out of the equipment, skimmer and return lines and cap them with duck plugs or winterizing plugs. A bit more involved is if solar is a part of heating system. Then all the equipment is unhooked and drained of all water. The electrical and gas supply are also turned off. A winter blanket is then placed over their pool held in place with water bags, landscape ties, or in case of above ground pool the cover is held in place with a cable that is tightened with a winch. The only thing one has to do till spring opening is to drain rain water off of cover to reduce cover stretching and damage. </p>

							<p>The other method and becoming more popular is to keep the pool running with no cover, or in some cases where there is an automatic or safety cover which can be left on throughout winter. Bypass the heater and drain, but keep water chemically balanced keeping close eye on PH and alkalinity. Adjust as needed - at least once a month. Maintain water level by draining to waste as the rain fills pool up. Rain on the west coast is high in acid and that is main reason why PH is so important to keep in check. If PH drops too low it will start stripping copper off your heat exchanger if not bypassed, and compromise life of heater and the chemistry of pool. It is also beneficial to vacuum once in a while so that leaves and debris do not stain liner or concrete.</p>

							<h2>Notes on Cleaning of Pools</h2>

							<p class="blog-indent">This is a system that I built to vacuum very dirty green algae pools without going through clients system. It consisted of a pool pump with a GFCI switch and heavy duty cord plugged into 110 outlet. The water is vacuumed through vacuum head on pole attached to a hose that is connected to the pump. It then goes through a cartridge filter and then a cyclone centrifuge that returns rather cleaner water to pool. The filter is taken out periodically to clean and the centrifuge has a lever on it to empty debris collected in bottom of unit. This worked extremely well on pools that were neglected throughout winter. The cyclone centrifuge can be plumbed into your regular system to improve water quality and cut down on water waste through backwashing.</p>

							<p>It is a good idea to keep an eye on your pool pumps and other equipment during swimming season for any signs of leaking or loud noises that are not common. At the first sign of a pump leaking, it should be serviced by replacing the mechanical seal and any gaskets that are compromised. If the motor becomes very loud, there is a decision to be made. If pump is over 10 years old, I recommend replacing the pump as the newer ones run more efficiently. The motors can be replaced, which I do quite often, but labour is unpredictable on older pumps as they can be very difficult to disassemble.</p>

							<p>Filters must be maintained to perform as they were designed to. There are sand filters and cartridge filters being used on pools today. They both need to be cleaned to maintain water quality. Cartridges should be taken out at least once a year to clean and should be replaced when water quality can no longer be maintained. You can figure on no more than 3 years for a set of filters. Sand should be replaced every 7 years or at some point where water quality cannot be maintained. Again if your sand filter is ancient, parts are not available for them and the entire unit should be replaced.</p>

							<h2>Pressure Gauges</h2>

							<p class="blog-indent">Your pool filter is a very important. There aren’t many moving parts on your filter and no electricity, but one thing that is present in every filter is pressure, and it is that pressure that drives the whole mechanism to carry on with its mission of cleaning your water. That is why you will find a little handy pressure gauge on the top of every filter. With it you can read the pressure on your filter and use that number as a guide to properly care for your pool.</p>

							<p>The pressure gauge is a simply little dial that is usually found on the top of your pool’s filter system. Most include ranges from 0 to 60 pounds per square inch (psi) that indicate how the pressure is holding (or not holding) in your pool.</p>

							<p>Knowing how to read this little gauge is, as you may have guessed, key in understanding what is happening with your pool’s filtration system.</p>

							<p>So what is normal? Unfortunately, this number is relative. Ideally it is the number that you record when you first install your pool filter and everything in your pool is running just as it should. If you don’t have that number, then your next best result is directly after you have changed the filter, backwashed, changed the sand or, at the very least, given it a good cleaning.</p>

							<p>Whichever route you have to take, make sure you record that number somewhere for future reference. Now that you have the number, you need to make sure you start checking the pressure at least once every week as a part of your normal pool maintenance routine.</p>

							<p>So what happens if you check your pool’s pressure and it seems high? Any reading that is 10 psi higher than your normal recorded pressure.  Basically, a high reading means that your filter system isn’t allowing the water to flow through it fast enough. This could mean that the filters need to be cleaned or replaced, or in case of sand filters, backwashing usually is sufficient. You should see a significant change in reading after doing this.</p>

							<p>Now your reading won’t always be too high. Sometimes it can be too low. This means that the water isn’t reaching your filter fast enough. Remember, while your pressure will fluctuate, it shouldn’t stray too far from your normal levels. In general, if the pressure is at least 5 psi lower than normal then a little extra attention is required.  Because these means water is not reaching the filter fast enough, this generally indicates a blockage of some type or maybe even a leak in your system. First, check the pump basket and impeller for any debris that could be clogging up the system and make sure the main drain covers aren’t blocked. Check around your pump carefully to see if you notice any leaks.</p>

							<p>These gauges don’t last forever and only cost around $20 to purchase, so you could actually have a problem with your gauge and not your pool.  If your gauge has some age on it or it is cracked, you may want to consider investing $20 to check to make sure you really do have a pressure problem and not just a gauge problem. In the end it could save you quite a bit of money.</p>

							<p>While the pressure gauge is just a small component in a large system, its role is vital to the overall health of your pool. Remember to check it weekly and never ignore pressure problems of any kind. If you do, you could end up doing more damage to your pool resulting in much more expensive repairs down the road. So play close attention to that little gauge, it could mean the difference between a pool that is crystal clear and ready for swimming, and one that is broken down in need of major repairs. </p>

							<p>This can seem like a simple task for the home owner to accomplish, but calling in a professional can take a lot of stress and frustration out of your corner.</p>
